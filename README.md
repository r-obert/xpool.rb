## <a id='introduction'>Introduction</a>

xpool.rb is a light weight in-memory process pool that was built with [xchannel.rb](https://github.com/rg-3/xchannel.rb).  A process pool can utilise all CPU cores on CRuby, while also providing an isolated memory space for running a job.  

An example use case for xpool.rb is any scenario where a task should be run asynchrousnly, for 
example to deliver an email in a web application or to perform a blocking task in the background.
 
## <a id='examples'>Examples</a>

1.

To schedule a job, define a class that responds to `#run`, then pass an instance
of that class to the `#schedule` method. The first argument given to `XPool.new` is 
the number of processes to populate a pool with. It defaults to the number of cores 
available on your computers CPU.

```ruby
# Be sure to define a job before initialising the pool or you could run into
# confusing serialisation errors.
class Job
  def run
    do_work
  rescue StandardError
    # It is recommended to always handle exceptions inside a job.
    # If an exception is not handled, the next job on the queue will run.
  end

  private 
  def do_work 
    # ...
  end
end
pool = XPool.new(2)
pool.schedule(Job.new)
pool.shutdown
```

2.

The `#schedule` method returns an `XPool::Process` object that you can interact
with. It represents the process chosen to run a job. Arguments can be passed to a job
from the `#schedule` method.

```ruby
class Job
  def run(email)
    deliver_email(email)
  rescue StandardError
    # It is recommended to always handle exceptions inside a job.
    # If an exception is not handled, the next job on the queue will run.
  end

  private 
  def deliver_email(email)
    # ..
  end
end
pool = XPool.new(2)
process = pool.schedule(Job.new, 'user@example.com')
process.id # => Process ID.
pool.shutdown
```

3.

Broadcast a job to run on all processes in a pool:

```ruby
class Job
  def run
    puts "Hello from #{Process.pid}"
  rescue StandardError
    # It is recommended to always handle exceptions inside a job.
    # If an exception is not handled, the next job on the queue will run.
  end
end
pool = XPool.new(4)
pool.broadcast(Job.new)
pool.shutdown
```

4. 

A pool can be resized to be bigger or smaller.

```ruby
class Job
  def run
    do_work
  rescue StandardError
    # It is recommended to always handle exceptions inside a job.
    # If an exception is not handled, the next job on the queue will run
  end

  private 
  def do_work
    # ...
  end
end
pool = XPool.new(4)
pool.shrink! 2 # Reduces the number of child processes to 2.
pool.expand! 3 # Increase the number of child procceses to 5.
```

## <a id='SIGUSR1'>The SIGUSR1 signal</a>

SIGUSR1 is reserved for use by xpool.rb, it is caught when shutting down a process.
Feel free to use `SIGUSR2` or any other signal instead.
